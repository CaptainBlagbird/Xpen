> Hi, thanks for stopping by.  
> I'm adding this update here to tell you that I'm not working on this app anymore. However, as a (much more advanced) alternative with the same concept based on 8pen, check out [8Vim by flide](/flide/8VIM). That app can also be found in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=inc.flide.vi8) and on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/inc.flide.vi8/).
